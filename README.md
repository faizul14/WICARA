  > Language is the main communication tool to convey expression in social life. Based on data
from labbineka.kemdikbud.go.id, there are about 718 nusantara languages spread throughout
Indonesia. However, every fifteen days, one nusantara languages in Indonesia will become 
extinct (Unesco, 2018). Even though the nusantara languages has its own unique value for local
tourism while on vacation. Some tourists who visit Indonesia sometimes do not understand the
nusantara language spoken by local residents who often use regional dialects and do not
understand English. Based on bps.go.id data, the number of domestic tourists in 2020 is
518 .588. 962. The number of people who go abroad, vacation, and study in areas that require
nusantara languages to communicate with each other. So it is better if there is a platform that
can revitalize nusantara languages and meet the needs of translators for local tourism in
Indonesia. Wicara is present as an application to translate nusantara languages into Indonesian
(vice versa) with a machine-translation model. Help solve existing problems in order to facilitate
local tourism in communicating. In addition, there are additional features that enhance the
learning of nusantara languages as an effort to preserve nusantara languages.
